### Day 1: April 06, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Setup Android Studio with a new project and created a new Github repo. Added an image through assets and changed the main color.

**Thoughts:** It took everything in me to start this. I've delayed for months on the notion that I didn't want to open-source my code for criticism, and what if my code was *so good* I wanted to close-source what I've done? Well, I threw both of those out of the window and decided to go ahead and get this thing going. I mean, right now is as great of a time for me as any. So with that, I'm on my way to a full-fledged Flutter app. Bringing in my love of my current favorite game, we shall see where this leads. I did find that if Android Studio is telling you Flutter is incompatible, there is probably an update for it. Oye. Off to a good start!

### Day 2: April 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Dart exercism exercise, reviewed lists and casting. Began implementing list and sliverappbar as well as adjusted the main app bar. Reviewed slivers and flexible space widgets. Started looking into unit testing for Flutter and Dart.

**Thoughts:** I found Flutter tests look just like Mocha; big win. I plan to incorporate those a little later. Not sure on Dart itself, but I haven't even though of what I'll need on that side for it to matter right now. Still having a bit of trouble reading the documentation. That and understanding the levels to which specific widgets apply.

### Day 3: April 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More work with Sliver lists; Completed Dart exercism exorcise.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm learning a lot already, but soo far behind. Just limiting the list was driving me crazy. ChildCount. Where? Ugh. Realized (thank goodness for the Internet) that I could return early from the closure (if that is what it's called in this case). Either way, that took up a bulk of my time. I read a lot more about Slivers which helped with my exploration of the documentation. 

### Day 4: April 09, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed importing a file; Added a custom widget and played around with the properties. Created a Map and looped the card widget. Enumerated a map.

**Thoughts:** Goodness. Who know enumerating would be such a pain. At first I though, how will this take me an hour? Again, understanding widgets is still yet out of my grasp. I'm getting there, though. Hooray! Very happy that so much syntax is the same and grateful for the Flutter documentation (it's even becoming less Greek). Just four days in and so much learned. 

### Day 5: April 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Optimized some of the code; Added an alarm intent using the android_intent plugin and a calendar event using a calendar plugin; Worked on exercise for Dart. Begin planning database.

**Thoughts:** Not sure yet how to do an equivalent intent call for iOS. I hope there is one. Regardless, I like that I can create intents pretty similar to Android/Kotlin. I thought about using an intent for the todo feature, but that's easy enough, and I want to customize it more to the animals in AC. I'm digging Flutter, but feel I should have gone with Kotlin/Android. 

Okay, and moments later realized a strength in Flutter with all of the plugins. Found a plugin to cross-platform add a calendar event. Huzzah. 

### Day 6: April 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added bottom navigation. Reviewed sqllite and practice.

**Thoughts:** 
Played around with trying to get an tabbed app bar nestedscrollview, but after much time decided "ain't nobody got time for that". Added a bottom nav, which was tons easier. Customized the buttons. Found that if you are using the bottom bar, use type: BottomNavigationBarType.fixed, otherwise your icons will be white.

### Day 7: April 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: No coding on Sundays (4/12). Low-tech! For Today,

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts:** 

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
