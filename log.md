# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 06, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Setup Android Studio with a new project and created a new Github repo. Added an image through assets and changed the main color.

**Thoughts:** It took everything in me to start this. I've delayed for months on the notion that I didn't want to open-source my code for critism, and what if my code was *so good* I wanted to close-source what I've done? Well, I threw both of those out of the window and decided to go ahead and get this thing going. I mean, right now is as great of a time for me as any. So with that, I'm on my way to a full-fledged Flutter app. Bringing in my love of my current favorite game, we shall see where this leads. I did find that if Android Studio is telling you Flutter is incompatible, there is probably an update for it. Oye. Off to a good start!

### Day 2: April 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Dart exercism exercise, reviewed lists and casting. Began implementing list and sliverappbar as well as adjusted the main app bar. Reviewed slivers and flexible space widgets. Started looking into unit testing for Flutter and Dart.

**Thoughts:** I found Flutter tests look just like Mocha; big win. I plan to incoporate those a little later. Not sure on Dart itself, but I haven't even though of what I'll need on that side for it to matter right now. Still having a bit of trouble reading the documentation. That and understanding the levels to which specific widgets apply.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
